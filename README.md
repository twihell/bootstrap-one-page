# bootstrap-one-page


I made this one-page project to practice Bootstrap and its main features and components. During my work, however, I had to override some default Bootstrap behaviors
to be able to incorporate my creative decisons. I also used jQuery to add some interactivity to the main section of my page. As for the styling, I wanted to add a
neon-like look to my page, so I eventually came up with a 'text-shadow'/'box-shadow' solution to brigten up my content. 


# Things to improve

The welcome heading has an infinite glow effect provided by the CSS animation property. However, I soon realized that having infinite animation on a page slows it 
down significantly, so I decided to minimize the outcome from using it by turning off animation on mobile devices. Nonetheless, it might still look a bit glitchy on
laptops sometimes. Unfortunately, I really like this neon-glow idea but don't yet know what I could replace such heavy styling with to gain the same type of 
visual effect but with faster rendering speed.

Another thing that could be improved, in my opinion, is UX design. It's not always clear to the user that big-size images might have captions on them, especially when
using the mobile version of the page. With the desktop version, it becomes clear fast thanks to the hover event handler applied to expose and hide the caption content. 
The mobile version, on the other hand, can only provide the same effect on tapping on the image. I put these and some other UX-related notes in the 'About' section 
of the page itself.
